A keygen is a program that generates serial numbers or license keys for software. A crack is a program that modifies the software to bypass its protection mechanisms. Both of these tools are illegal and can violate the software's terms of service and copyright laws. Moreover, they can expose your computer to hackers who can steal your personal information, damage your files, or take control of your device.
 
Therefore, it is not recommended to use a keygen or a crack for AVG Internet Security 2014 or any other software. Instead, you should buy a legitimate license key from the official website or a trusted reseller. This way, you can enjoy the full benefits of the software and support its development. You can also avoid the risks of malware infection and legal trouble.
 
If you still want to try a keygen or a crack for AVG Internet Security 2014, you should be very careful and scan any downloaded file with a reliable antivirus program before running it. You should also backup your important data and create a restore point in case something goes wrong. However, there is no guarantee that these tools will work or that they won't harm your system.
 
In conclusion, using a keygen or a crack for AVG Internet Security 2014 is not worth it. You are better off buying a genuine license key and enjoying the security and peace of mind that the software provides.
